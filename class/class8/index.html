                Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.I'll miss you Michael, your music and dance forever inspirational, but you will live in my heart forever, RIP. LOUISE NEW: I am deep shock like the rest of the world, i never got to see one of his concerts but loved everything about him, to the film him made 'MOONWALKER' to the ever so talented dancer. <a id="tribute-link"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson" target="_blank" >Read More.</a>
